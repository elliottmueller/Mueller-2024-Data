# Mueller-2024-Data
This dataset includes Orbitrap raw data that has been transformed into .isox files using the ThermoFisher software IsoX. The Kidd Creek files represent dual inlet measurements on a HF QExactive ESI-Orbitrap mass spectrometer from January 2023. To process the files, the open source IsoXL files can be used with the Dual Inlet processing method. Each file represents a dual inlet measurement including 7 total blocks (4 standard blocks and 3 sample blocks). The Birchtree files are direct infusion measurements (AAAABBBBAAAA, where A is standard and B is sample). These are collated into a 'combined' file format that can also be run on IsoXL but in the "Direct Infusion" or "Autosampler" module. This module will output the isotope ratios of all the sample and standard measurements. These can then be transformed into delta notation following the calculations of Mueller et al. Analytical Chemistry (2021).
